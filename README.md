<h3>About MOD TEMPLATE</h3>
<p>This is a mod template for me to use when starting a new project.  It prevents me from opening up a lot of files and comparing them in a text editor.</p>
<p>Make sure to check the build.gradle and update all instances of modname.  Mappings need to be updated as well.</p>

<h3>List of Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Literally</li>
<li>Nothing</li>
<li>At</li>
<li>All</li>
</ul>

<h3>To Modpack Developers</h3>
<p>Do whatever you want with the mod buy please don't bundle it on the Technic platform.
That ecosystem is terrible and many mod creators including myself do not support it.
Ultimately I cannot stop you nor do I care to try, but if you want to do right by me then credit with links is appreciated.</p>
