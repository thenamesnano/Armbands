<h3>About Armbands</h3>
<p>Armbands is a mod inspired by features present in DayZ Standalone.  In that game players (who don't have names of their heads) 
can equip colored armbands to help them identify teammates and prevent friendly fire.  I thought this was a good idea for a 
modpack I was working on in the past called Wicked World, a modpack that had player nameplates were removed.  While I didn't 
finish the mod back then I still think the concept has potential.  That has led us to here.</p>

<h3>List of Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Armbands that can be worn in the chest slot.</li>
<li>The ability to dye armbands.</li>
<li>Curios support.</li>
</ul>

<h3>To Modpack Developers</h3>
<p>Do whatever you want with the mod buy please don't bundle it on the Technic platform.
That ecosystem is terrible and many mod creators including myself do not support it.
Ultimately I cannot stop you nor do I care to try, but if you want to do right by me then credit with links is appreciated.</p>
